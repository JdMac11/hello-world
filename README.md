Tradition 


Hi, my name is James and I am currently learning to become a System Support Technician Specialist.

I am attending Tulsa Community College (T.C.C) in which, has a great I.T. program with retired or new professors helping hone the craft of I.T. students in their respected specialities.

I will be conducting independent research in the I.T. field. 
On acount that I live so far out of the urban area, where it seems the multitudes of like-minded individuals dwell. 

Github.com will allow me to reach out into forum and discuss current projects with elder and novice I.T. centered professionals.

This is why I'm here.
